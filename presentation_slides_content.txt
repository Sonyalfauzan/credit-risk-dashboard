================================================================================

SLIDE 5: EXPLORATORY INSIGHTS
------------------------------
Top Risk Factors Identified:

1. Interest Rate
   • High correlation with defaults
   • Reflects initial risk assessment

2. Credit Score (FICO)
   • Scores <640 show 2x higher default rate
   • Strong inverse relationship with risk

3. Debt-to-Income Ratio
   • DTI >35% significantly increases default probability
   • Indicates repayment capacity strain

4. Loan Grade
   • Clear gradient: Grade A (lowest risk) to G (highest risk)
   • Grade F-G show 3x higher default rate

5. Revolving Credit Utilization
   • High utilization (>80%) signals financial stress
   • Strong predictor of payment difficulties

[Include: 5 small charts showing each factor's impact on default rate]
